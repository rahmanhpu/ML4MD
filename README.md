# cs653-final (Need a repo name)
  
## Members: Jose Cobena and Spencer Ortega
  
## 1. Problem description:
  Reducing cpu hours by using Machine Learning to predict properties from MD simulations.
  Properties: melting point, diffusion coefficient, etc.
## 2. Simulation methods and algorithms, numerical methods, and parallel and distributed computing (or data visualization and analysis) techniques to be used.
  LAMMPS - Parallel MD Simulation
  Machine Learning - supervised learning (regression, decesion tree, knn) unsupervised learning (clustering)
  
## 3. Expected results.
  Algorithm/Model that can be used for these predictions.
