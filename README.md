# ML for MD simulations
  
## Authors
Jose Cobena (jcoben@usc.edu) - PhD CHE  
Spencer Ortega (sportega@usc.edu) - MS CS 
  
## Problem
Reducing cpu hours by using machine learning to predict ( some property ) from MD simulations.  
Properties ex: melting point, diffusion coefficient, etc.  

## Methods
LAMMPS - Parallel MD simulator
What kind of simulation? ( nano tube with water )  
Machine Learning - supervised learning (regression, decesion tree, knn, NN) unsupervised learning (clustering)  

## Expected Results
Algorithm/Model/weights that can be used for to predict these MD properities.
