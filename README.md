## Authors
Jose Cobena (jcobena@usc.edu) - PhD CHE  
Spencer Ortega (sportega@usc.edu) - MS CS 
  
## Problem
Reducing cpu hours by using machine learning to predict ( some property ) from MD simulations.
features: nano tube diamater, water density, temperature
Properties ex: diffusion coefficient and relaxation time.  

## Methods
LAMMPS - Parallel MD simulator
What kind of simulation? ( nano tube with water )  
Machine Learning - supervised learning (regression, decesion tree, knn, NN) unsupervised learning (clustering)  

## Expected Results
Algorithm/Model/weights that can be used for to predict these MD properities.
