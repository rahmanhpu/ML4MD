## Problem description:
Reducing cpu hours by using machine learning to predict ( some property ) from MD simulations.  
Properties ex: melting point, diffusion coefficient, etc.  

## Methods:
LAMMPS - Parallel MD simulator
What kind of simulation? ( nano tube with water )  
Machine Learning - supervised learning (regression, decesion tree, knn, NN) unsupervised learning (clustering)  

## Expected results.
Algorithm/Model/weights that can be used for to predict these MD properities.
