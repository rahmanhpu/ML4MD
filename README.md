## Members: 
Jose Cobena - PhD CHE  
Spencer Ortega - MS CS HPC 
  
## Problem description:
Reducing cpu hours by using Machine Learning to predict properties from MD simulations.  
Properties: melting point, diffusion coefficient, etc.  

## Methods:
LAMMPS - Parallel MD Simulation  
Machine Learning - supervised learning (regression, decesion tree, knn) unsupervised learning (clustering)  

## Expected results.
Algorithm/Model that can be used for to predict these MD properities.
